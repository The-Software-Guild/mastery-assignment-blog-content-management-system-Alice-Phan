## Project Specs and Client Usage

1. Display blog posts to everyone who comes to the owner's site.

2. Give a way for the owner to enter blog posts so that only they can add thme

3. The client does not want to have to write HTML. They need a way to write posts in an editor, something with an interface like Wordpress. They would like to use TinyMCE.

4. The client will need to add static pages that only they cn write to that will allow pictures to be posted as well as text.
